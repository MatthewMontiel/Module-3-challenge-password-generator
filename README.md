password generator

Created a Password Generator in JavaScript that generates a password when given set criteria.

## Description

The main purpose of the project was to create a functioning password generator when given some starter code. There were some components of the code already in place, but it still took a bit of tinkering to get things to work properly. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
When you click the generate password button you will then be asked a series of questions. Based on those questions you will add criteria to the generator and it will then create a password for you.
